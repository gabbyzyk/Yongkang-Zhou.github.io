Welcome! Iâ€™m **Yongkang Zhou**, a second-year M.S. student in Computer Technology at East China Normal University (ECNU), advised by Prof. Junjie Yao. My research interests lie in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Information Retrieval**.

My current research focuses on building reliable and efficient LLM systems, with particular interest in retrieval-enhanced
generation and graph-based reasoning. I am also open to broader directions where LLMs can be applied responsibly and
effectively for societal benefit
