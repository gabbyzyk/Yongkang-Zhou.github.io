Welcome! I’m **Yongkang Zhou**, a second-year M.S. student in Computer Technology at East China Normal University (ECNU), advised by Prof. Junjie Yao. My research interests lie in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Information Retrieval**.

My current work explores how to model source reliability and structure-aware retrieval in multi-source RAG settings. I have presented my work at *DASFAA 2025 (oral)*, and have submissions under review at *ICDE* and *CIKM*.
