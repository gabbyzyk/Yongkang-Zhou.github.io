Welcome! Iâ€™m **Yongkang Zhou**, a second-year M.S. student in Computer Technology at East China Normal University (ECNU), advised by Prof. Junjie Yao. 
My current research focuses on building reliable and efficient LLM systems, with particular interest in retrieval-enhanced
generation and graph-based reasoning. I am also open to broader directions where LLMs can be applied responsibly and effectively for societal benefit
