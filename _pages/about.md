Welcome! Iâ€™m **Yongkang Zhou**, a second-year M.S. student in Computer Technology at East China Normal University (ECNU), advised by Prof. Junjie Yao. 

My current research focuses on building reliable and efficient **Large Language Model** systems, with a particular emphasis on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
and **Information Retrieval**. I am also open to broader directions where LLMs can be applied responsibly and effectively for societal benefit
